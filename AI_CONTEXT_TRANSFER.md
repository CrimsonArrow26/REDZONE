# AI Context Transfer for ClockTower App Development

## **Current State of the Application**

The ClockTower app is a mobile-based web application built with **React and TypeScript**, utilizing **Leaflet JS** for map functionalities and **Supabase** as its backend (authentication, database, real-time). The app is fully complete and accessible with authentication.

## **Implemented Features (Summary)**

1.  **Red Zone Safety Automation (Initial)**:
    *   When a user enters a red zone, safety parameters activate.
    *   Phone sensors (gyrometer, accelerometer, microphone) turn on (with permission).
    *   Physics-based detection for potential accidents (e.g., sudden stop from high speed).
    *   A `SafetyConfirmationPopup` appears on the homepage asking if the user is safe, accompanied by a 5-minute beep sound that stops upon user confirmation.

2.  **Stationary User Detection & Admin SOS**:
    *   If a user, after confirming safety, remains stationary in a red zone for more than 10 minutes, an automated SOS alert is sent to an admin.
    *   A **usable Admin Dashboard** has been created with Supabase authentication to view and manage these alerts.
    *   Admin messages contain the user's last location, time, and date of being stationary.

3.  **Comprehensive 5-Parameter Safety Monitoring System**:
    *   **Voice Level Detection**: SOS to admin if voice level > limit in red zone.
    *   **Accelerated Speed**: SOS to admin if sudden increase in speed.
    *   **Decelerated Speed**: SOS to admin if sudden decrease in speed (including complete stop).
    *   **Is Stationary**: SOS to admin if stationary for > 10 minutes (after initial safety confirmation).
    *   **Voice Keyword**: SOS to admin if keyword "satyam" is heard while traveling. This parameter activates *only if* any of the other four parameters are already active.
    *   **Implementation Details**:
        *   `src/utils/safetyMonitor.ts`: Core logic for sensor monitoring, accident/stationary detection, voice level, and keyword detection (using Web Audio API and Web Speech API).
        *   `src/context/ZoneContext.tsx`: Manages global state, integrates `SafetyMonitor` and `SOSService`, handles callbacks for all detection types.
        *   `src/utils/sosService.ts`: Handles sending SOS alerts to admins, dynamically categorizing alert types (`stationary_user`, `voice_keyword`, `voice_level`, `speed_accident`), and includes Nominatim for reverse geocoding.
        *   `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx`: Displays and allows management of all types of SOS alerts.

4.  **Popup Notification System (Replacement for Browser Alerts)**:
    *   All `alert()`, `confirm()`, `prompt()` calls have been replaced with custom React components:
        *   `SafetyAlertPopup.tsx`: For critical, modal-style alerts (e.g., red zone entry, SOS triggered, permission requests).
        *   `ToastNotification.tsx`: For less critical, transient messages (e.g., "SOS sent successfully").
    *   Managed centrally via `NotificationContext.tsx` and `useNotification` hook.
    *   Integrated into `App.tsx`, `ZoneContext.tsx`, and `safetyMonitor.ts`.

## **Database Schema Updates (Supabase)**

*   **`admin_users` table**: Stores admin user details (user_id, email, role, permissions, is_active).
*   **`sos_alerts` table**: Stores all automated SOS alerts (user_id, latitude, longitude, location_address, alert_type, status, created_at, stationary_duration_minutes, user_message, red_zone_id).
*   **`user_movement_logs` table**: Logs user movement data (user_id, latitude, longitude, speed, acceleration, is_moving, red_zone_id, timestamp, safety_status).
*   **Foreign Key Fixes**: Corrected `red_zone_id` type from `UUID` to `BIGINT` in `sos_alerts` and `user_movement_logs` to match `red_zones.id`.
*   **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Temporarily disabled on `admin_users` to unblock development; needs proper re-configuration.

## **Recent Fixes and Improvements**

### **Location Stability System**
*   **Issue**: User location was constantly changing due to GPS jitter, causing unstable behavior in red zone detection and location-based features.
*   **Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive location stability system that analyzes GPS patterns and requires multiple consistent readings before updating the user's location.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   Created `src/utils/locationStability.ts` with `LocationStabilityManager` class
    *   Buffers the last 5 GPS readings and analyzes them for consistency
    *   Requires at least 2 readings within 30 meters of each other to establish stability
    *   Minimum 5-second interval between location updates to prevent jitter
    *   Calculates averaged position from stable readings for better accuracy
    *   Includes confidence scoring based on GPS accuracy
*   **Updated Components**:
    *   `src/context/ZoneContext.tsx`: Now feeds GPS readings to stability manager instead of direct location updates
    *   `src/pages/RedZones.tsx`: Uses stable location system for consistent map positioning
    *   `src/pages/ReportIncident.tsx`: Prioritizes stable location for incident reporting
    *   `src/pages/Reports.tsx`: Uses stable location for crime reporting accuracy
*   **Debugging Tools**: Added development-only location debug panel to Home page for testing and monitoring
*   **Result**: Significantly more stable location tracking, reduced false zone transitions, and improved user experience

### **Speed Unit Conversion**
*   **Issue**: Accident detection messages displayed speeds in m/s (e.g., "11699.5 m/s") which were unrealistic demo values.
*   **Fix**: Updated `safetyMonitor.ts` to convert all speed values from m/s to km/h in accident detection messages using the conversion factor `1 m/s = 3.6 km/h`.
*   **Result**: More user-friendly speed displays (e.g., "Sudden deceleration from 54 km/h to 0 km/h").

### **Voice Recognition (Microphone Listening) Fixes**
*   **Issue**: Microphone got permission but was not actively listening for the keyword "satyam".
*   **Root Cause**: Web Speech API lifecycle management issues, missing error handling, and no continuous listening restart logic.
*   **Fixes Applied**:
    *   Added proper `onend` event handler to restart speech recognition when it stops
    *   Enhanced error handling with automatic restart for transient errors
    *   Added comprehensive logging for debugging voice recognition status
    *   Improved `startKeywordListening()` and `stopKeywordListening()` methods with better error handling
    *   Added public methods `testVoiceRecognition()` and `getMicrophoneStatus()` for debugging
*   **Testing**: Added voice recognition test button to Home page (development mode only) for easier debugging.

### **Enhanced Debugging**
*   Added console logging for speech recognition lifecycle events
*   Added microphone status checking methods
*   Added development-only test buttons for safety features and voice recognition
*   Added location stability debug panel with real-time GPS reading analysis
*   Improved error messages and status reporting

## **Pending Tasks / Next Steps**

*   **RLS Policies**: Re-enable and properly configure RLS policies for `admin_users` and `sos_alerts` tables to ensure robust security.
*   **Comprehensive Testing**: Thoroughly test the full 5-parameter safety monitoring system, including all triggers, SOS alerts, and admin dashboard functionality.
*   **Test Environment Setup**: Facilitate testing with multiple accounts (admin and regular user) on localhost.
*   **Facial Recognition**: Future feature to be integrated, leveraging existing context.
*   **Voice Recognition Testing**: Test the fixed microphone listening functionality to ensure keyword "satyam" is properly detected and triggers admin alerts.
*   **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize the continuous voice recognition to prevent battery drain and ensure reliable operation.
*   **Location Stability Fine-tuning**: Test and adjust location stability parameters based on real-world usage patterns.
